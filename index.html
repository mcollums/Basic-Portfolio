        <p>
            Hello everyone! I’m Michelle and I was born in Shreveport, LA and raised in San Antonio, TX. I went to school at Texas State University in San Marcos, TX where I graduated in 2016 with my BS in Mass Communications and Public Relations. For the past couple years, I worked as the Communications Manager at a non-profit where I gained experience in graphic design, project management and communications planning. 
            <br /> In July of 2018, I started exploring career options that would allow me to work anywhere in the world and web development was the one that stood out to me the most. After much thought and planning, I’m so excited to be a part of this bootcamp and start my career as a web developer. 
            <br /> My hobbies include playing video games, horseback riding, spending time outdoors, traveling and reading.</p>
